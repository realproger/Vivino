# Welcome to My Vivino
***

## Task
In this project, we aim to enhance My Vivino's wine recommendation system, which currently relies on outdated rules-based methods. The challenge is to leverage data science techniques to create a more effective and personalized wine recommendation system.

## Description
To address the challenge, we have undertaken a comprehensive data analysis and modeling process. We have collected and cleaned wine-related data, explored its patterns and correlations, and developed a machine learning model to provide wine recommendations based on user preferences.
